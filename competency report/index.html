     <h2 id=Elcallejondelbeso >El Callejon del Beso: A Love Story in Guanajuato</h2>

    <p>The story is told that Ana was the only daughter of an obstinate and violent man. She was being courted by a poor but handsome young man, Carlos. When her father found out, he forbade her to go out, threatened to send her to a convent, and worse, to marry her off to an old, rich Spanish nobleman, by which the father’s estate would be restored to its former glory.

     <p> Love-stricken Carlos imagined a thousand things he might do, and settled on one after much deliberation. There was a window in Ana’s house that opened onto a narrow alleyway, so narrow in fact that it was possible to touch the wall of the house across the way by leaning out the window.</p>
     
     <p>Carlos thought that if he could enter that house opposite Ana’s, he would be able to talk to her, and the two of them might devise a solution to their problem. He found the owner of the house and bought it immediately, paying in gold.</p>
            
     <p>Every night, Ana and Carlos dated in secret and their love began to grow. On one evening, while Ana and Carlos where together, her father discovered them and became enraged. The father madly made his way toward his daughter, a dagger in his hand. In a fit of rage, he stabbed her in the chest.</p>
            
    <p>Carlos, in shock, stood with Ana’s hand in his. Coming to his senses and realizing what had happened, he gently kissed his love’s hand, now lifeless and cold.</p>
            
    <p> Ana and Carlos were dead. The father went insane and died a few months later.</p>
            
     <p> According to tradition, all the couples in love who visit this site should kiss while standing on the third step, which is painted red. This will assure fifteen years of happiness; couples who don’t comply with this tradition will have seven years of bad luck.</p>

     <h2 id="CempasuchilFlower" >The Legend of the Cempasuchil Flower</h2>

   <p>This wonderful love story began when the two young Aztecs were still little. They used to spend all their spare time playing and enjoying discovering their town together. Although  Xochitl was a delicate girl, her family let her join in the adventures of her neighbor Huitzilin.  With time, it was only natural that their love would flourish.</p>
 
 
    <p>They particularly enjoyed hiking to the top of a near mountain where they would offer flowers to the Sun god Tonatiuh. The god seemed to appreciate their offering and would smile from the sky with his warm rays.  On a particularly beautiful day at the top of the mountain, they swore that their love would last for ever.</p>
         
     <p> When war broke out the lovers were separated as Huitzilin headed to fight and protect their homeland.</p>
    
    
     <p>  Soon the dreaded news of  Huitzilin‘s death reached Xóchitl.  She felt her world falling to pieces, her heart completely torn.
    She decided to walk one last time to the top of the mountain and implore the sun god  Tonatiuh, to somehow join her with her love Huitzilin.  The sun moved by her prayers threw a ray that gently touched the young girl’s cheek. Instantly she turned into a beautiful flower of fiery colors as intense at the sun rays.</p>

    <p>Suddenly a hummingbird lovingly touched the center of the flower with its beak.
            It was Huitzilin that was reborn as a handsome hummingbird.  The flower gently opened its 20 petals,  filling the air with a mysterious and lovely scent.
            The lovers would be always together as long as cempasuchil flowers and hummingbirds existed on earth.
    
            This is how the cempasúchil  flower came to be the Day of the Dead Flower.</p>
